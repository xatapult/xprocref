XProcRef describes the [XProc](https://xproc.org/) steps in a more user-friendly way than the official specification. The resulting (static, GitHub pages) website is [https://xprocref.org/](https://xprocref.org/).

It is still work in progress and doesn't describe all the steps yet. The code that generates the website is somewhat under-documented. Over time this situation will hopefully improve.
